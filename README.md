# Log-Transformation-of-Image
Log transformation is an __image enhancement__ technique in which dark pixels are expanded as compared to the higher pixel values.
This enhancement technique only makes sense when **low value pixels are more** than higher ones in the input image.

$ s=c*log(1+r) $
r: input intensity levels
s: output intensity levels
c: constant
